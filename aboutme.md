### Research interests/ Expertise

- Depression
- Anhedonia (decreased ability to experience pleasure)
- Reward deficits

My primary research interest is anhedonia. Anhedonia is the loss of pleasure or interest in things that were previously found pleasurable, and a not yet fully understood core symptom of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

### Carreer path

Between 2013 and 2017, I was part of a biopsychosocial study into anhedonia. The word anhedonia is derived from the Greek words “An” and “hedone”, literally meaning without pleasure. Whereas sad mood is the most prototypical (and arguably more often studied) symptom of MDD, we know comparably little about anhedonia, and how it can be remedied. MDD has a high prevalence rate, and its burden on society is large. However, MDD is also a very heterogeneous disorder that is hard to treat. It may well be that MDD treatment efectiveness can be improved by targeting its core symptoms instead of its syndrome. Together with the ‘No Fun No Glory’ research team, I collected survey data among nearly 3000 young adults; set out Ecological Momentary Assessment study (EMA) in which we sampled subjective experiences for multiple times a day for multiple days; and developed an EMA-based intervention.

In the EMA-based intervention, participants got feedback in the form of EMA-based visualization of their personal associations between behavior and pleasure. For example, if the associations showed that more physical exercise was related to higher levels of levels of PA for that particular participants, and there was room for improvement, participants would be advised to become more physically active. How to implement these behavioral changes successfully in the participants' daily life was determined in close consultation with the participant, and tailored to their preferences and personal schedules. This form of personalized medicine approach proved helpful, as pleasure experiences were regained and anhedonia reduced thereafter. 

Because of its potential to enhance the effectiveness of current MDD treatment in a cost-efficient manner, and our biopsychosocial study into anhedonia attracted large media coverage (e.g., in Algemeen Dagblad; Volkskrant; and Dagblad van het Noorden). An additional important element is that the anhedonia symptom is a transdiagnostic symptom. That is, apart from its prominent role in depression, anhedonia is also common in many other psychiatric illnesses such as substance use disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. Novel findings on the true nature of anhedonia or its remedies may thus not only be important to the field of depression but will likely also have spill-over effects to fields focusing on other disorders in which anhedonia is common.

Whereas in our intervention we focused on the mean levels of pleasure, tn my Ph.D. thesis entitled: “The happy, the sad, and the anhedonic”, I studied the fluctuations in pleasure levels over time in people with and without anhedonia. Using EMA, I confirmed some findings from neuroscientific and laboratory research but also discovered some new peculiar features of anhedonia. For example, the definition of anhedonia suggests that it involves flat and blunted positive emotionality. Yet, in my Ph.D. research, I discovered that the daily positive emotions of anhedonic individuals are anything but flat and blunted, but rather show remarkable variability and instability over time. My findings provide a starting point to understand the true nature of pleasure and alterations thereof in anhedonia.

My Ph.D. work has been awarded several grants, awards, and travel bursaries, allowing me to gain international experience in the United States and Belgium. Whereas my first collaborative work on positive emotion dynamics in anhedonia was sparked during my research stay at the Seattle Pacific University in the United States, my KNAW Academy Ter Meulen Grant and the Post Doctoral Mandate of the KU Leuven internal fund allowed me to continue this line of research at the University of Leuven in the lab of professor Kuppens, a world-leading expert in emotion dynamics. So far my publications can be found in top 10% journals, and are cited by high-impact journal articles for which authors have to make a strict selection of their references such as Nature Reviews Neuroscience, and Nature Human Behaviour.

### Interdisciplinary

With a background in Social work, Psychology, Sociology, and Psychiatry, I am an interdiscplinary trained researcher. Currently, I further investigate anhedonia as an interdisciplinary postdoc at the University of Groningen. Within the focal area Deficits, Distress, and Disorders, I combine insights from among others, sociology, psychology, pedagogics, educational science, and psychometrics to investigate the causal mechanisms of psychopathological disorders, and their effects on everyday functioning.

### Advocate of Open Science

Finally, I am an advocate for [Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/foster-taxonomy/open-science), meaning that I: love research transparency; pre-register my confirmatory analyses apriori (e.g., on [OSF](https://osf.io/)); use Open Workflow Tools (e.g., [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html); publish in [Open Access journals](https://doaj.org); make my data and annotated syntaxes publicly available (e.g., via [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com). I am also an [ambassador for Open Access](https://libguides.rug.nl/umcg/openaccess/home) of the University of Groningen and University Medical Centre Groningen, which means that I stimulate and enable the implementation of open access in my faculty.
