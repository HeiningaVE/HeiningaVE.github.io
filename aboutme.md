I aim for robust and reproducible research, and try to be as transparent as I can be by publishing in [open access journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access), [pre-registrating my analyses](https://osf.io/7n4qu/), and making [my data and syntaxes](https://osf.io/k7rfu/) publicly available.
