Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the at the University of Leuven, Belgium. As part of the research group Quantitative Psychology and Individual Differences, I investigate anhedonia. Anhedonia is the loss of pleasure or interest in things that were previously found pleasurable, and a not yet fully understood core symptom of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

For more information on what I do or have been doing, please see [a short description of my current project ](https://www.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/portaal/#/projecten/3H170397?hl=en&lang=en), or [my full Curriculum Vitae](https://heiningave.github.io/CV/).

In my research into anhedonia, I try to be as transparent by publishing in [open access journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access), [pre-registrating my analyses](https://osf.io/7n4qu/), and making[my data and syntaxes](https://osf.io/k7rfu/) publicly available.
