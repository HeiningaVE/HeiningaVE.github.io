### Research interests/ Expertise

- Depression
- Anhedonia (decreased ability to experience pleasure)
- Reward deficits

My primary research interest is anhedonia. Anhedonia is the loss of pleasure or interest in things that were previously found pleasurable, and a not yet fully understood core symptom of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

### Carreer path

Between 2013 and 2017, I was part of a biopsychosocial study into anhedonia. The word anhedonia is derived from the Greek words “An” and “hedone”, literally meaning without pleasure. Whereas sad mood is the most prototypical (and arguably more often studied) symptom of MDD, we know comparably little about anhedonia, and how it can be remedied. MDD has a high prevalence rate, and its burden on society is large. However, MDD is also a very heterogeneous disorder that is hard to treat. It may well be that MDD treatment efectiveness can be improved by targeting its core symptoms instead of its syndrome. Together with the ‘No Fun No Glory’ research team, I collected survey data among nearly 3000 young adults; set out Ecological Momentary Assessment study (EMA) in which we sampled subjective experiences for multiple times a day for multiple days; and developed an EMA-based intervention.

In the EMA-based intervention, participants got feedback and personalized advice based on their personal pleasure associations. For example, if the associations showed that more physical exercise was related to higher levels of levels of PA for that particular participants, and there was room for improvement, participants would be advised to become more physically active. How to implement these behavioral changes successfully in the participants' daily life was determined in close consultation with the participant, and tailored to their preferences and personal schedules. We investigated the effects of personalized lifestyleadvice, and whether an intense experience that will elicit strong positive responses (e.g., skydiving) could help to implement the recommended lifestyle changes. In our Randomized Controlled Trial, the personalized lifestyleadvice proved helpful (see: [van Roekel, Vrijen, Heininga, Masselink, Bos, & Oldehinkel, 2017](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0005789416300843?token=4DB2AB00A05A0B08D18A5EC89899EFB039AE3038804A19F1AEAF15776D09D10B089602592A3D60E7C1B9DC258FFDEAF6)).

In my Ph.D. thesis entitled: “The happy, the sad, and the anhedonic”, I compared anhedonic to non-anhedonic individuals in their ability to 1) pursue, 3) experience, and 3) learn about pleasure in daily life. Indeed, anhedonia is clinically defined as the “markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day” (American Psychiatric Association, 2013a), but was predominantly investigated in the laboratory (e.g., by using tasks or brain scanner in combination with a single time questionnaire). Using EMA to look at the three components of pleasure loss in daily life, I confirmed some findings from laboratory research but also discovered some new peculiar features of anhedonia. For example, the definition of anhedonia suggests that it involves flat and blunted positive emotionality. Yet, in my Ph.D. research, by using an EMA design, I was able to show that positive emotions in the daily life of anhedonic were anything but flat and blunted, as they tend to fluctuate more than their non-anhedonic counterparts. To further investigate this intriging conundrum, I was awarded a KNAW Academy Ter Meulen Grant and the Post Doctoral Mandate of the KU Leuven internal fund, allowing me to gain international experience in the United States and Belgium. 

### Interdisciplinary

Currently, I am an interdiscplinary postdoc within the faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences of the University of Groningen. My focal areas are Deficits, Distress, and Disorders. That is, I combine insights from among others, sociology, psychology, pedagogics, educational science, and psychometrics to investigate the causal mechanisms of psychopathological disorders, and their effects on everyday functioning.

### Advocate of Open Science

Finally, I am an advocate for [Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/foster-taxonomy/open-science), meaning that I: love research transparency; pre-register my confirmatory analyses apriori (e.g., on [OSF](https://osf.io/)); use Open Workflow Tools (e.g., [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)); publish in [Open Access journals](https://doaj.org); make my data and annotated syntaxes publicly available (e.g., via [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com)). I am also an [ambassador for Open Access](https://libguides.rug.nl/umcg/openaccess/home) of the University of Groningen and University Medical Centre Groningen, which means that I stimulate and enable the implementation of open access in my faculty.
