### Research interests/ Expertise:

- Depression
- Anhedonia (decreased ability to experience pleasure)
- Reward deficits

Between 2013 and 2017, I was part of the ‘No Fun No Glory’ research team investigating anhedonia. The word anhedonia is derived from the Greek words “An” and “hedone”, literally meaning without pleasure. Whereas sad mood is the most prototypical (and arguably more often studied) symptom of MDD, we know comparably little about anhedonia, and how it can be remedied. 
Together with ‘No Fun No Glory’ research team, I collected survey data among nearly 3000 late adolescents; set out Ecological Momentary Assessment study (EMA) in which we sampled subjective experiences for multiple times a day for multiple days; and developed an EMA-based intervention.

The EMA-based intervention consisted of an in-depth investigation of within-person associations between behavioral factors and pleasure experiences and encouraging anhedonic participants to change their behaviors accordingly in order to increase pleasure. For example, participants got feedback in the form of EMA-based visualization of their personal associations between behavior and pleasure. For example, if the associations showed that more physical exercise was related to higher levels of levels of PA for that particular participants, and there was room for improvement, participants would be advised to become more physically active. How to implement these behavioral changes successfully in the participants' daily life was determined in close consultation with the participant, and tailored to their preferences and personal schedules. This form of personalized medicine approach proved helpful, as pleasure experiences were regained and anhedonia reduced thereafter. However, EMA-data provides a wealth of other information besides the mean pleasure level such as, for example, how participants' pleasure experiences fluctuate over time.

In my Ph.D. thesis, I studied positive emotional fluctuations in anhedonia, entitled: “The happy, the sad, and the anhedonic”. Using EMA, I confirmed some findings from neuroscientific and laboratory research but also discovered some new peculiar features of anhedonia. For example, the definition of anhedonia suggests that it involves flat and blunted positive emotionality. Yet, in my Ph.D. research, I discovered that the daily positive emotions of anhedonic individuals are anything but flat and blunted, but rather show remarkable variability and instability over time. My findings provide a starting point to understand the true nature of pleasure and alterations thereof in anhedonia. Hopefully, my future work into the micro-mechanisms of pleasure will provide new clues on how to treat anhedonia more effectively.

My Ph.D. work has been awarded several grants, awards, and travel bursaries, showing academic potential and allowing me to gain international experience in the United States and Belgium. Whereas my first collaborative work on positive emotion dynamics in anhedonia was sparked during my research stay at the Seattle Pacific University in the United States, her KNAW Academy Ter Meulen Grant and the Post Doctoral Mandate of the KU Leuven internal fund allowed her to continue this line of research at the University of Leuven in the lab of professor Kuppens, a world-leading expert in emotion dynamics. So far her publications can be found in top 10% journals, and are picked-up by high-impact journal articles for which authors have to make a strict selection of their references such as Nature Reviews Neuroscience, and Nature Human Behaviour.

Depression has a high prevalence rate, and the burden that depressive disorders place on society is large. Because of its potential to enhance the effectiveness of current MDD treatment in a cost-efficient manner, the study attracted large media coverage (e.g., in Algemeen Dagblad; Volkskrant; and Dagblad van het Noorden).  An additional important element is that the anhedonia symptom is a transdiagnostic symptom. That is, apart from its prominent role in depression, anhedonia is also common in many other psychiatric illnesses such as substance use disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. Novel findings on the true nature of anhedonia or its remedies may thus not only be important to the field of depression but will likely also have spill-over effects to fields focusing on other disorders in which anhedonia is common.

Currently, I am an interdisciplinary postdoc with a focus on Deficits, Distress, and Disorders in daily life. In my work, I aim for robust and reproducible research (e.g., by using R Markdown), and try to be as transparent as I can be by publishing in open access journals, pre-registering my analyses apriori, and making my data and annotated syntaxes publicly available. I am also an ambassador for Open Access of the University of Groningen and University Medical Centre Groningen.
