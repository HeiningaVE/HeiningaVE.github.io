Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the at the University of Leuven, Belgium. As part of the research group Quantitative Psychology and Individual Differences, I investigate anhedonia. Anhedonia is the loss of pleasure or interest in things that were previously found pleasurable, and a not yet fully understood core symptom of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

I aim for robust and reproducible research, and try to be as transparent as I can be by publishing in [open access journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access), [pre-registrating my analyses](https://osf.io/7n4qu/), and making [my data and syntaxes](https://osf.io/k7rfu/) publicly available.
