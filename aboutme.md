Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the at the University of Leuven (KU Leuven), Belgium, where I investigate the micro-mechanisms of anhedonia. 

Anhedonia is the loss of pleasure or interest in things that were previously found pleasurable, a detrimental experience, and a not yet fully understood core symptoms of depression. 

For more information, see [my project description](https://www.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/portaal/#/projecten/3H170397?hl=en&lang=en), and [my CV](https://heiningave.github.io/CV/).

In my research into anhedonia, I try to be as transparent by publishing in [open access journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access), [pre-registrating my analyses](https://osf.io/7n4qu/), and making[my data and syntaxes](https://osf.io/k7rfu/) publicly available.
