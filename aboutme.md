I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the research group quantitative psychology and individual differences at the KU Leuven, University of Leuven, Belgium. Please find my CV [here](https://www.rug.nl/staff/v.e.heininga/cv).

My main research interests are mood and mood disorders, and the anhedonia symptom in particular. Anhedonia is the loss of pleasure or interest in things that were previously found pleasurable, a detrimental experience, and a not yet fully understood core symptoms of depression.

Between 2013 and 2017, as part of [the "No Fun, No Glory" project](https://nofunnoglory.nl/en), at the Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion regulation (ICPE) of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) in the Netherlands, my collegues and I collected a large amount of awesome data on anhedonia. Please email me or one of [my collegues](https://nofunnoglory.nl/en/research-group) if you would be interested in using our data!

Using the diary part of the "No Fun, No Glory" project, I wrote [my PhD thesis](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/c22377_f6d9d466111c42e8a75ce6c4cbced4a7.pdf) on this fascinating topic. 

In my research into anhedonia, I try to be as transparent as I can be. I preferably publish open access, I [pre-registrate my data](https://osf.io/7n4qu/), and I make all [my used data and syntaxes](https://osf.io/k7rfu/) publicly accessible.
