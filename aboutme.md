### Research interests/ Expertise
- Affect and affective disorders
- Psychopathology
- Open Science

I combine insights from psychology, sociology, and psychometrics to unravel biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying the onset and maintenance of depressive symptoms.

Open Science is critical to accelerating the way we discover knowledge. Therefore, I pre-register my analyses (e.g., on Open Science Framework); use Open Workflow Tools (e.g., R Markdown); publish Open Access; and make my data & code publicly available (e.g., via Code Ocean) as much as possible.

### Interdisciplinary approach

Currently, I am an interdisciplinary postdoc with a focus on Deficits, Distress, and Disorders. That is, in order to improve interdisciplinary cooperation within the faculty of Behavioral and Social Sciences of the University of Groningen, I organize events. For example, I organized a hack-a-thon event during which I invited faculty staff to think along with the large interdisciplinary national crowdsourcing study among youth (aged 8-18) I am currently involved in (see also: [Recent Projects](https://heiningave.github.io/projects/)), and a [large symposium on interdisciplinary inspiration](https://heiningave.github.io/2020-02-25-BSS-symposium-Interdisciplinary-Inspiration-was-a-great-succes!!/).

### Biopsychosocial study into anhedonia

Between 2013 and 2017, I was part of a biopsychosocial study into anhedonia (i.e., markedly diminished interest or pleasure; see: [recent projects](https://heiningave.github.io/projects/)). Together with the ‘No Fun No Glory’ research team, I collected survey data among nearly 3000 young adults; set out Ecological Momentary Assessment study (EMA) in which we sampled subjective experiences for multiple times a day for multiple days; and developed an EMA-based intervention to regain pleasure in daily life.

#### EMA intervention

In the EMA-based intervention, participants got personalized advice based on their daily life pleasure associations. For example, if the associations showed that more physical exercise was related to higher levels of levels of PA for that particular participants, and there was room for improvement, participants would be advised to become more physically active. How the behavioral changes were implemented in the participants' daily life was made more specific in close consultation with the participant, and tailored to their personal needs. In addition to personalized advice, we investigated whether an intense thrill experience such as a skydive could help to reset the pleasure disturbances. In our Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), the personalized advice proved helpful, but a skydive did not amplify the intervention-effect.

#### Reward dysfunction in daily life

I was the first to examine affective reward functioning in anhedonic individuals' daily lives. That is, I compare anhedonic to non-anhedonic individuals in their ability to 1) pursue, 3) experience, and 3) learn about pleasure in daily life. These three components of reward functioning are typically investigated in the laboratory (e.g., by using tasks or brain scanner). Using EMA, I confirmed some laboratory findings, but not all. For example, individuals with anhedonia typically show a blunted reaction to rewarding laboratory stimuli. Yet, using an EMA design, I was able to show that the reward reactivity in individuals with anhedonia was anything but blunted. Intrigued by this conundrum, and passionate to solve it, I was awarded a KNAW Academy Ter Meulen Grant and the Post Doctoral Mandate of the KU Leuven internal fund to tackle this puzzle together with prof. Peter Kuppens in Belgium.
