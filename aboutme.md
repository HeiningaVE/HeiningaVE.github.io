### Research interests/ Expertise
- Affect
- Psychopathology
- Depressive symptoms
- Open Science

I combine insights from psychology, sociology, pedagogics, educational science, and psychometrics to unravel psychosocial and behavioral mechanisms underlying psychopathological disorders.

Because I think it is important that others are able to verify and check my results, and to distinguish exploratory research from confirmatory research, I pre-register my confirmatory analyses a priori (e.g., on OSF); use Open Workflow Tools (e.g., R Markdown); publish in Open Access journals; make my data and annotated syntaxes publicly available (e.g., via Code Ocean) as much as possible.

### Interdisciplinary approach

Currently, I am an interdisciplinary postdoc with a focus on Deficits, Distress, and Disorders. That is, in order to improve interdisciplinary cooperation within the faculty of Behavioral and Social Sciences of the University of Groningen, I organize events. For example, I organized a hack-a-thon event during which I invited faculty staff to think along with the large interdisciplinary national crowdsourcing study among youth (aged 8-18) I am currently involved in (see also: [Recent Projects](https://heiningave.github.io/projects/)), and a [large symposium on interdisciplinary inspiration]().

### Psychopathology

Between 2013 and 2017, I was part of a biopsychosocial intervention study into anhedonia (i.e., markedly diminished interest or pleasure). Together with the ‘No Fun No Glory’ research team, I collected survey data among nearly 3000 young adults; set out Ecological Momentary Assessment study (EMA) in which we sampled subjective experiences for multiple times a day for multiple days; and developed an EMA-based intervention te regain pleasure in daily life.

In the EMA-based intervention, participants got personalized advice based on their daily life pleasure associations. For example, if the associations showed that more physical exercise was related to higher levels of levels of PA for that particular participants, and there was room for improvement, participants would be advised to become more physically active. How the behavioral changes were implemented in the participants' daily life was made more specific in close consultation with the participant, and tailored to their personal needs. In addition to lifestyle advice, we investigated whether an intense experience that would elicit strong positive responses could help to implement the recommended lifestyle changes (i.e., a skydive). In our Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), the personalized lifestyle advice proved helpful, but a skydive did not amplify the intervention-effect..
(see: [van Roekel, Vrijen, Heininga, Masselink, Bos, & Oldehinkel, 2017](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0005789416300843?token=4DB2AB00A05A0B08D18A5EC89899EFB039AE3038804A19F1AEAF15776D09D10B089602592A3D60E7C1B9DC258FFDEAF6)).

I was the first to examine affective functioning in anhedonic individuals' daily lives. That is, I compare anhedonic to non-anhedonic individuals in their ability to 1) pursue, 3) experience, and 3) learn about pleasure in daily life. These three components of reward functioning are typically investigated in the laboratory (e.g., by using tasks or brain scanner). Using EMA, I confirmed some laboratory findings, but not all. For example, individuals with anhedonia typically show a blunted reaction to rewarding laboratory stimuli. Yet, using an EMA design, I was able to show that the reward reactivity in individuals with anhedonia was anything but blunted. Intrigued by this conundrum, and passionate to solve it, I was awarded a KNAW Academy Ter Meulen Grant and the Post Doctoral Mandate of the KU Leuven internal fund to tackle this puzzle together with prof. Peter Kuppens in Belgium.
