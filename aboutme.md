I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the research group quantitative psychology and individual differences at the KU Leuven, University of Leuven, Belgium. Please find my CV [here](https://www.rug.nl/staff/v.e.heininga/cv).

My main research interests are mood and mood disorders, and the anhedonia symptom in particular. Anhedonia is the loss of pleasure or interest in things that were previously found pleasurable, a detrimental experience, and a not yet fully understood core symptoms of depression.

Between 2013 and 2017, as part of [the "No Fun, No Glory" project](https://nofunnoglory.nl/en), at the Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion regulation (ICPE) of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) in the Netherlands, my collegues and I collected a large amount of awesome data on anhedonia. Please email me or one of [my collegues](https://nofunnoglory.nl/en/research-group) if you would be interested in using our data!

Using the diary part of [the "No Fun, No Glory" project](http://nofunnoglory.nl/en/), I wrote [my PhD thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/api/literature/privateDownload?publicationUid=RhloCxMqNUXqhLKNiiZqR3Et42pzXcEW4kVIHrAjmUmBekCWMZIXRLBkFBpj7FcvGw&linkId=XG6cbxbTqlKNtWgnWpmZNAabf5GzAVnMO0PezZPg3EIbOxVVC6Doq4DFj0ZA32GhY-YSjQdqghSvuzk_Kz9RhA) on this fascinating topic. 

In my research into anhedonia, I try to be as transparent as I can be. I publish open access where possible, pre-registrate my data [here](https://osf.io/7n4qu/), and my data and syntaxes are publicly accessible [here](https://osf.io/k7rfu/).
