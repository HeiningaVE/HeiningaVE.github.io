Participation is free, but [registration is required](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbSeR0jDoU4hPfR7ism-33ORAv2V4cu7AyUGsBx3wGOvKj5g/viewform).

*What typifies the Netherlands and the Dutch? What is Dutch identity exactly? We are happy to welcome Sjoerd Beugelsdijk, one of the editors of the multidisciplinary report "Thinking of the Netherlands” (“Denkend aan Nederland" in Dutch) of the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP). Based on a large-scale survey study and focus group research, this report is a collection of analyses, thematic studies, and essays on Dutch identity, combining different disciplinary perspectives (sociology, history, philosophy). Sjoerd Beugelsdijk will use this report as a case study to reflect on the challenges, risks and added value of interdisciplinary research.*
