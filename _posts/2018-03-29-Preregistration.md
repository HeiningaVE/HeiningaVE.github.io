subtitle: The dynamic nature of anhedonia in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
---

Anhedonia (loss of pleasure) is defined as loss of pleasure or experience of positive emotions.

In contrast, in experience-sampling studies, individuals with anhedonia show remarkable differences in their moment-to-moment pleasure experiences (Heininga et al., 2017).

Further study of these dynamics is essential for understanding anhedonia; particularly, how they manifest in patients diagnosed with MDD.
