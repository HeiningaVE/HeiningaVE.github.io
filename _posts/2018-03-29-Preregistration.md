Anhedonia (loss of pleasure) is defined as loss of pleasure or experience of positive emotions.

In contrast, in a study into sub clinical levels of anhedonia (i.e., report loss of pleasure but are not (yet) diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder), indidivuals with anhedonia showed remarkable differences in their moment-to-moment pleasure experiences(Heininga et al., 2017).

Further study of these dynamics is essential for understanding anhedonia; particularly, how they manifest in patients diagnosed with MDD.
