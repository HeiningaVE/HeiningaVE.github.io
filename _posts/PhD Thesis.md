Anhedonia, the loss of pleasure, is highly prevalent in both clinical and non-clinical
populations but far from fully understood. Anhedonia was recently reconceptualized
into an impaired ability to pursue, experience, and learn about pleasure. Although
plausible, a major caveat of this reconceptualization is that it is almost exclusively
based on studies that use a nomothetic approach to knowledge (macro-level
perspective), largely neglecting how altered reward function in anhedonia takes shape
idiographically (micro-level perspective).

This PhD thesis sheds a first light on altered reward function in anhedonia from
a micro-level perspective. The perspective is provided by the use of recent
technologies (e.g., smartphones) and Experience Sampling Methods (ESM). ESMs
allow for reliable sampling of moment-to-moment experiences, and holds
considerable promise for improving the current understanding of anhedonia. In Part I,
we investigated anhedonic individualsÂ´ ability to pursue pleasure (chapter 2), to
experience pleasure (chapter 3), and to learn from pleasurable experiences (chapter 4).
Differences were found in some, but not all, aspects of reward function.

Scientific studies often contradict each other, and Part II of this PhD thesis
addresses two problems related to research reproducibility: Different
operationalizations of the same construct (chapter 5) and chance capitalization
(chapter 6).
