Why?

We have another new year ahead, hopefully with many new opportunities for interdisciplinary cooperation!

To kick-start new interdisciplinary co-operations within our faculty, we invite you to the Behavioural and Social Sciences Symposium for INTERDISCIPLINARY INSPIRATION on January 21, from 13:00-17:00, Nieuwe Kerk, Groningen. Participation is free, but registration is required.

The program looks as follows:  
12:00 – 13:00                Lunch (free), have lunch with colleagues while enjoying the beautiful ambience of the church.
13:00 – 13:05                Opening, by Rita Landeweerd
13:05 – 13:45                Keynote lecture: Managing risk in multidisciplinary research, by SCP-editor Sjoerd Beugelsdijk

*What typifies the Netherlands and the Dutch? What is Dutch identity exactly? We are happy to welcome Sjoerd Beugelsdijk, one of the editors of the multidisciplinary report "Thinking of the Netherlands” (“Denkend aan Nederland" in Dutch) of the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP). Based on a large-scale survey study and focus group research, this report is a collection of analyses, thematic studies, and essays on Dutch identity, combining different disciplinary perspectives (sociology, history, philosophy). Sjoerd Beugelsdijk will use this report as a case study to reflect on the challenges, risks and added value of interdisciplinary research.*
