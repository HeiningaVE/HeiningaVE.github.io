Under the condition that you pre-register your research plans before April 1st with us (and later on 
@OSFramework), we are willing to include your instrument (s) in our data collection*

\* provided that this is technically possible and the plan falls within the research framework of the project: strengths, deficits, and/ or distress in children and adolescents (8-18 years). In case of many entries, the team will make a selection.
