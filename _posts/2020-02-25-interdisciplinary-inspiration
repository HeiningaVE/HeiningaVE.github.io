# Inspiration and challenges: the first edition of the BSS symposium on Interdisciplinary Inspiration

A brief recap of the first edition of the BSS symposium on Interdisciplinary Inspiration. It was a great success and will hopefully result in many new opportunities and inspiration for interdisciplinary cooperation with our faculty.

To stimulate new interdisciplinary co-operations within our faculty, all staff and students of the Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences (BSS) were invited to the Interdisciplinary Inspiration symposium on January 21, from 12:00-17:00, Nieuwe Kerk, Groningen. The event was a great success, as it attracted around a hundred BSS faculty students and staff of all disciplines and of all stripes.

## Interdisciplinary postdocs are on a mission
After starting with a wonderful lunch buffet, Dr. Rita Landeweerd (Board member and Managing director) opened the event on behalf of the faculty board, with a short introduction on the strategic plan and the strategic theme to connect people. The BSS Faculty has given shape to this theme by appointing three interdisciplinary postdocs: Dr. Maaike Engels with the focal area of Lifespan Development and Socialization, Dr. Anne Marthe van der Bles with the focal area of Individuals in Society and Organizations, and Dr. Vera Heininga with the focal area of Deficits, Distress, and Disorders. In addition to their own research, these interdisciplinary postdocs are on a mission to increase the level of interdisciplinary research within the BSS faculty by organizing events, including the Interdisciplinary Inspiration Symposium.

## Typical challenges of interdisciplinary research
The event started with a Keynote on the do’s and don’ts for interdisciplinary research by one of the editors of the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP), prof. Sjoerd Beugelsdijk. Prof. Beugelsdijk reflected on his experiences with interdisciplinary as an interdisciplinary researcher, as an editor of an interdisciplinary journal,  and as one of the authors of the recent "Thinking of the Netherlands” (2019; “Denkend aan Nederland" in Dutch) report. This report is based on a large-scale survey study and focus group research, and is a collection of analyses, thematic studies, and essays on Dutch identity, combining different disciplinary perspectives (sociology, history, philosophy). He discussed what typifies the Netherlands and the Dutch, and whether there exists something like a Dutch identity. In addition, he discussed the typical challenges of interdisciplinary research, and his reflections on how to effectively organize interdisciplinary research. After discussing the do’s (e.g., meeting frequently; clear end goals) and don’ts (e.g., large physical distance; challenging the basic disciplinary assumptions), prof. Beugelsdijk turned to the risks of interdisciplinary research, such as being discarded as “weak” researchers. However, the risks of interdisciplinary research are generally manageable, mostly by defining clear roles with hierarchical structures at the beginning of an interdisciplinary project and team science. He advocated that senior staff, and not junior staff, should be more accountable for interdisciplinary efforts. Senior staff should, for instance, take full managerial responsibility and bear the risk of failure.


## Interdisciplinary Talks
The first block of talks starred all kinds of interdisciplinary research from within the BSS Faculty – starting with a talk on sexual identity. Ole Gmelin (developmental psychology) and Julian Rengers (Sociology) presented their joined research interest: contextual and interactional factors in sexual identity disclosure decisions. They designed a vignette-based study that considered both conveyed acceptance cues (e.g. stereotyped thinking) and contextual factors, for which they combined methods and theories from work and organizational psychology, developmental psychology and sociology.

Next, Dr. Tina Kretschmer delivered a pledge on why social sciences need to invite geneticists to the table. She argued that genetics can at least partly explain, and moderate, environmental effects (e.g., aggression or bullying). Furthermore, unlike their proxies which are often measured in social sciences, genes are more stable entities and more objectively measurable. During the discussion of her talk, another advantage was highlighted: genotyping has become more and more affordable: around €30 per person.

Tessa Kaufman continued on the topic of bullying by presenting her recently developed application of network diagnostics to monitor and tackle bullying and victimization. This tool illustrates the social classroom dynamics which can help teachers to gain insights in the social structures and effectively tackle bullying.

The last speaker of the first block was Dr. Toon Kuppens, who showcased his interdisciplinary research endeavors on education-based status. He discussed how education reproduces inequality through education-based status. More specifically, he showed that Honours Students felt individually superior to other students, especially in terms of competence.

The second block of interdisciplinary talks started with Dr. Nina Hansen and Dr. Liesbet Heyse, who studied how integration of Eritrean newcomers at the workplace can be improved. Over and beyond the mere acceptance of differences, Dr. Hansen and her team discovered that – in order to instigate change - training was key. Together, they developed a training to improve integration at the workplace in which employers learned concrete skills to handle cultural differences in communication. One of the things Dr. Liesbet Heyse mentioned that she learned from during this project was that the interdisciplinary project also came with an additional challenge with regards to data integration.

Someone who co-developed a tool specifically designed to collect longitudinal data on smartphones is Dr. Mandy van der Gaag, the second speaker of the second block. She explained how the tool works, how it can integrate data from multiple sources (e.g., teacher, mentors and students) and that the tool performs well as it successfully facilitates research participation among a difficult target group (adolescents at risk for early school leaving). The tool is open source, meaning that it is openly available to everyone who wants to use it (see u-can-act.nl or github.com/compsy/u-can-act). Moreover, interested researchers can adapt the source code of tool to fit their research needs. The tool is already used by new projects across different disciplines, such as Every Child Is Different (psychology), and Differentiation inside out (pedagogy).

Next, Jasmine Muradchanian talked about publication bias across different disciplines (i.e., the likelihood of a study being published based on its findings), and the extent to which it affects metrics of replication success. She simulated 100%, 75% and 0% publication bias, and compared replication success across different metrics (e.g., significance, meta-analytical findings or bayes factor). Jasmine showed that the extent to which publication bias affects metrics of replication success differs across the different metrics as well as across the different simulated levels of publication bias levels.

Jasperina Brouwer lastly talked about interdisciplinary research in health care professions. She examined factors that contribute to the decision of leaving or staying in the healthcare profession by applying a social network approach. Preliminary results show that nurses turn to other nurses (similar in hierarchy) for social support instead of others higher in rank.


## Best Poster Award by Carla Roos
PhD students were invited to present and pitch their interdisciplinary research through poster presentations. All poster presentations were well-attended and resulted in many scientific discussions. The poster presentations were evaluated by three researchers, representing the three scientific institutes: Dr. Jacob Dijkstra (The Groningen Centre for Social Science Research), Dr. Marjon Fokkens-Bruinsma (The Nieuwenhuis Institute) and prof. Marieke Pijnenborg (The Heymans Institute). After two rounds, the jury unanimously decided on the best poster: Carla Roos, MSc with her poster entitled “Why online social regulation may fail: The lack of ambiguity and responsiveness” (supervised by Dr. Namkje Koudenburg and Prof.  Tom Postmes). Prof. Sjoerd Beugelsdijk had the honour to award her with a best poster certificate, flowers, and a book on science communication. After this ceremony, all participants were invited for drinks and had the opportunity to talk more about interdisciplinary research.

The first edition of the BSS symposium on Interdisciplinary Inspiration was a great success and hopefully resulted in many new opportunities and inspiration for interdisciplinary cooperation!
