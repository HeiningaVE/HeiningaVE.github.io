My name was put forward by the board of your department or faculty, as one of the students and staff member who "contributed to the University in a special way over the past year". [Very memorable experience](https://twitter.com/wijmenga_cisca/status/1206621160940670979?s=20), having the honor to meet and sit next to the Director Finance & Control of the University of Groningen and newly appointed rector magnificus of the University of Groningen.
