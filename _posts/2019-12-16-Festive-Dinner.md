[Gosh, very memorable experience](https://twitter.com/wijmenga_cisca/status/1206621160940670979?s=20), having the honor to meet and sit next to inspiring people - some of which you do not meet every day (e.g., the Director Finance and Control of the University of Groningen and the newly appointed rector magnificus of the University of Groningen). My name was put forward by the board of my department/faculty, as one of the students and staff member who "contributed to the University in a special way over the past year". Very much appreciated. Thank you!
