  <summary>About </summary>

We were the first to provide a complete overview of anhedonia in the daily lives of MDD patients in terms of hourly fluctuations in pleasure, increase in positive emotions as a function of events, and getting back to baseline in depressed patients with anhedonia. The overview is a valuable addition of knowledge as 20% of young adults experience anhedonia and circa 70% of all depressed patients suffer from anhedonia. Depression affects 300 million people worldwide - about 5% of all people.

  <summary>About </summary>
	
Together, we developed and executed an intervention for anhedonic young adults: personalized lifestyle advice, which is advice tailored to one’s personal situation. Based on a month of diary study, statistical analyses were performed for each person separately to investigate which lifestyle factors were associated with pleasure.

<details>
  <summary>About </summary>
	
To improve understanding of inconsistent findings, in particular in the field of psychiatric genetics, I transparently tested all possible analytic options and evaluated whether inconsistent evidence in a field is more likely due to methodological differences or chance capitalization. Methodological differences across studies were a likely reason for the inconsistent findings with regard to 5HTTLPR-Childhood adversity interaction on depression, but chance capitalization was at least equally plausible. The novel model multiverse approach is important to all fields of science that use statistics to test their hypotheses, because they all deal with variable and model selection.

> *Altmetric Attention Score*: The Altmetric Score is an automatically calculated, weighted count of all of the attention a research output has received online. ![](/img/altmetric.jpg) Further information about how the Altmetric Attention Score is calculated is available [here](https://www.altmetric.com/about-altmetrics/the-donut-and-score/).

> *Open Science score*: 88% of your research is free to read online. This level of availability puts you in the top 2% of researchers accroding to https://profiles.impactstory.org/. Moreover, 35% of my papers are published under a fully Open license like CC-BY, making them available for a wide range of reuse (not just reading). This important because Open Science is critical to accelerating the way we discover knowledge, and research funders are able to more quickly and efficiently maximize their return on investment.

* [See preregistration](https://osf.io/zbekw)  
* [See preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/t2j7p)
* We identified two lifestyle-based risk factors for anhedonia in in the daily life of depressed patients: low relationship quality and fear of abandonment.
* Important to the fiel of clinical psychology, because literature on factors that can influence momentary anhedonia on an hourly time-scale are scarce.
* Relevant for clinical practice, because clinical practitioners that aim to reduce depressed patients’ anhedonia may benefit from targeting the social stressors in their therapies/ interventions.

* We critically discuss a novel, simplified version of a primary emotion-based decision-making task.
* Adds to experimental psychology research, because our findings suggest that both tasks are unsuited for test-retest purposes.
* Important for clinical practice, because the simplified paradigm differs conceptually from the original, thereby casting doubt on the authors’ plea to use the easier-to-administer-task in patients with, for example, brain injuries.
