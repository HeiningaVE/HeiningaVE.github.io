* Altmetric Attention Score: Altmetrics data is provided by Altmetric.com, a research metrics company who track and collect the online conversations around millions of scholarly outputs. Altmetric continually monitors a variety of non-traditional [sources](https://www.altmetric.com/about-altmetrics/our-sources/) to provide real-time updates on new mentions and shares of individual research outputs, which are collated and presented to users via the Altmetric [details pages](https://www.altmetric.com/about-altmetrics/altmetric-details-page/) and [badge visualisations](https://www.altmetric.com/products/altmetric-badges/). Each research output that Altmetric finds attention for is also given a score; a weighted count of the online attention it has received. Further information about how the Altmetric Attention Score is calculated is available [here](https://www.altmetric.com/about-altmetrics/the-donut-and-score/).

* Open Science score: 50% of my research is free to read online. According to ImpactStory (i.e., [total-impact.org](www.total-impact.org), this level of availability puts me in the **top 26%** of openness by researchers. Moreover, 41% of my papers are published under a fully Open license like CC-BY, making them available for a wide range of reuse (not just reading). This important because Open Science is critical to accelerating the way we discover knowledge, and research funders are able to more quickly and efficiently maximize their return on investment.
