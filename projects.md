### No fun no glory: a biopsychosocial investigation of how adolescents lose the ability to experience pleasure and may gain it back again. 
#### [2013-2017 | PhD project](https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/research-projects/i/79/9579.html)
This study is a biological psychological and behavioral study into anhedonia (decreased capability to experience pleasure). Anhedonia is a core symptom of depression, yet not fully understood. This study was set out to 1) Better understand which lifestyle factors play a part in loss of pleasure; 2) Investigate whether personalized lifestyle advice can help people with anhedonia to regain pleasure; 3) See if a tandem skydive can help people with anhedonia to carry out the lifestyle advice in their daily lives.
