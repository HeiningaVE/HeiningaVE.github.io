subtitle: Research on anhedonia

Between 2013 and 2017, as part of [the "No Fun, No Glory" project](https://nofunnoglory.nl/en), 
my collegues and I collected a large amount of awesome data on anhedonia. 

I wrote [my PhD thesis](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/c22377_f6d9d466111c42e8a75ce6c4cbced4a7.pdf) on this fascinating topic, 
using the experience sampling method, also referred to as a daily diary method, or ecological momentary assessment (EMA) part 
of the "No Fun, No Glory" project.

Please visit our website for [more information](http://nofunnoglory.nl/en/), 
or email me or one of [my collegues](https://nofunnoglory.nl/en/research-group) if you would be interested in using our data!
