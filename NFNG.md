subtitle: Research on anhedonia

Between 2013 and 2017, my collegues and I collected a large amount of awesome data on anhedonia, as part of a project called ["No Fun, No Glory"](https://nofunnoglory.nl/en). 

Using the part of the project in which data was obtained through experience sampling method, also referred to as a daily diary method, or ecological momentary assessment (EMA), I wrote [my PhD thesis](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/c22377_f6d9d466111c42e8a75ce6c4cbced4a7.pdf) on this fascinating topic of anhedonia.

or email me or one of [my collegues](https://nofunnoglory.nl/en/research-group) if you would be interested in using our data!
